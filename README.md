## ‚úÖ Features

**Forum Routes**: The API offers a range of forum functionality, allowing users to create posts, comment on existing discussions, and engage with other pedal enthusiasts. Users can share their experiences, seek advice, and exchange insights, fostering a vibrant and collaborative community.

**Likes, Dislikes, and Sharing**: Users can express their opinions and appreciation for posts and comments through the ability to like or dislike them. The API also supports easy sharing of presets, enabling users to explore different sound settings and experiment with their pedals.

**Attachments**: Users can attach files, such as images or audio samples, to enrich their posts and comments. This feature enables users to provide visual representations or audio examples of their pedal setups, modifications, or unique sound creations, fostering more comprehensive discussions.

**User Interaction**: The API promotes user networking by allowing users to follow each other. This functionality facilitates connections within the community, encouraging collaboration, knowledge sharing, and fostering a sense of belonging among VTR pedal users.

**Software Updates**: The API keeps users informed about software updates for their products. Users receive notifications and relevant information to ensure they have access to the latest features and improvements.

**Instruction Manuals**: Users can access instruction manuals through the API, providing them with detailed guidance on how to optimize their pedal usage and explore advanced functionalities.

**Second-Hand Transfer**: In the case of second-hand sales, the API facilitates the transfer of ownership between users, ensuring a smooth and secure process for transferring pedals to new owners.

**Product Catalog**: The API provides a comprehensive list and information on all VTR effects pedals, including those not yet owned by the user. This feature allows users to explore and discover other VTR pedals, expanding their knowledge and options.

**Warranty Terms and FAQs**: The API offers access to warranty terms and answers to frequently asked questions, addressing common concerns and providing users with essential information regarding product support and after-sales service.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture
The VTR Effects Pedals API is built on a robust and scalable architecture, leveraging various technologies and services to ensure reliable performance and seamless integration. Here are some key architectural components:

**Backend**: The backend of the API is developed using C#, a powerful programming language known for its performance and versatility. C# allows for efficient handling of requests and supports a wide range of features and libraries for building robust APIs.

**JWT Token Validation**: To secure the API endpoints and authenticate users, the API utilizes JWT (JSON Web Token) validation. This industry-standard method provides a secure and stateless approach to user authentication and authorization.

**Caching with Redis**: Redis is employed as a caching layer to enhance the API's performance and reduce the load on the database. By storing frequently accessed data in Redis, the API can retrieve information quickly, resulting in improved response times and scalability.

**Dependency Injection**: The API follows the principles of dependency injection to manage dependencies and promote modular and maintainable code. By implementing dependency injection, the API ensures loose coupling between components and facilitates easier testing and extensibility.

**Azure SQL Database**: The API utilizes an Azure SQL Database as its data storage solution. Azure SQL Database provides a highly reliable, scalable, and secure platform for storing and managing the API's data, ensuring data integrity and availability.

**Azure App Services**: The API is deployed and hosted on Azure App Services. Azure App Services offers a fully managed platform for deploying web applications, providing automatic scaling, high availability, and easy management of the API's infrastructure.
